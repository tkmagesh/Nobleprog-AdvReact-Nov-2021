Redux?
    Library for managing state in React
    Why do we need it?


State
    UI State
        Any data that supports the "presentational (ui)"  needs of the application
        It is highly UNLIKELY that this data (state) is needed in other parts of the application
        Feel free to use React.useState() to manage the UI state in the component itself

    App State
        Any data that supports the "core logic (domain)" of the application
        It is highly LIKELY that this data (state) is needed in other parts of the application
        DO NOT maintain this data in the component 

Choices of managing App State
    1. Redux
    2. Mobx
    3. Context API
    4. Reflux
